# 2027 Chicago Cubs Free Agent Analysis: Jesús Luzardo

---

## Executive Summary
This project analyzes whether **Jesús Luzardo** represents a high-value free agent for the Chicago Cubs entering the 2027 season. Using the starting pitcher aging-curve theory, performance data, salary benchmarking, and surplus-value analysis, the evaluation demonstrates that Luzardo offers a rare combination of prime-age performance, rotation fit, and cost efficiency relative to both the Cubs’ existing staff and the broader under-30 2027 free-agent pitching market.

---

## Organizational Context
* The Cubs enter the 2026–27 window with strong positional depth, driven by long-term commitments to core hitters and emerging stars.
* In contrast, pitching continuity is fragile, with most of the rotation and bullpen scheduled for free agency after 2026.
* Only two pitchers are under guaranteed contracts entering 2027, creating significant exposure for a team projected to compete for the NL Central.
* The Cubs’ 2025 postseason exit underscored the cost of pitching fatigue and the organizational need for rotation depth.

## Analytical Framework
This repository evaluates Luzardo through four lenses:

### 1. Pitcher Aging Curve
* Research consistently shows that starting pitchers peak between ages 28–30.
* Luzardo enters free agency within this window, allowing the Cubs to capture projected peak production.

### 2. Peer Group Comparison
Among under-30 free-agent starters projected for the 2027 class, Luzardo leads his cohort in:
* Career WAR: 11.4
* Career starts: 121
* Strikeout rate: 26.7%
* Peers include other 2027 free agents under the age of 30 like Kris Bubic, Dustin May, Trevor Rogers, and Michael Soroka, all of whom trail Luzardo in cumulative value.

### 3. Salary Value and Performance Alignment
Figure 1: Age vs. Salary Comparison
* Cubs starters exhibit rising salary commitments as age increases.
* Luzardo’s projected salary places him below the Cubs’ internal salary curve while being younger than the 2025 rotation average (29.8).
* This age-salary inefficiency creates acquisition leverage.

Figure 2: WAR vs. Salary (Surplus Value)
* Using an industry-standard valuation of $8M per WAR, Luzardo shows one of the largest positive gaps between expected WAR and salary.
* Cheaper pitchers in the class sacrifice performance, while higher-priced arms underperform in terms of WAR relative to cost.
* Together, these visuals identify Luzardo as undervalued by the market.

### 4. Risk Assessment
* Medical history: Prior back and left elbow issues
* Mitigation strategy: Limit long-term exposure while capturing peak-age value
* Competitive upside: Luzardo’s 2025 season performance (seventh in NL Cy Young voting at age 28) suggests durability and elite performance

## Contract Recommendation
Proposed Offer:
2 years, $24 million ($12M AAV)

Rationale:
* Capture Luzardo’s prime seasons
* Limit long-term medical risk
* Provide rotation stability during a projected pennant race
* Offer the player upside via re-entry into free agency at age 30
